#BackboneExt
An example rails application using backbone.js with ejs templating and twitter bootstrap,
used to demo/test my backbone extension classes.

##Setup
Do something like this:

```
bundle
rake db:create db:migrate db:populate
rails s
```

##Generic Stuff
The code in `vendor/assets/backbone_ext` is base code that I use for most Backbone js applications.
